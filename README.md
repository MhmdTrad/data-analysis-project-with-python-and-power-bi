# data-analysis-project-with-python-and-power-bi
According to SHIA training, we were asked to work on a data analysis project from scratch, and We were given the option to choose any data set from the kaggle website and i have selected a dataset called 'Data science job salaries'.
 i used different libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib and power bi tools.
 I am really proud of what I achieve until now and looking forward to improving my skills in the future.
